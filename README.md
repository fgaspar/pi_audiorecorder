# Audio recorder for Raspberry Pi

This project aims at creating a python script capable of triggering audio recording with the press of a button on a keyboard on a headless pi.

Recordings will be ongoing while a button is pressed and events during a recording can be labeled by pressing other configurable buttons.

A use case for this script will be to gather sound samples to use as a dataset for ML.
